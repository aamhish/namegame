# NameGame

Are you a FIRST Addict? This is the game for you! Originally developed for the [FRC Discord Server](http://discord.gg/frc), this little game's mecahnic is all about knowing the most amount of teams. Each player will take a turn naming a team number and that team's name, but the catch is that the named team has to start with the last digit of the previous picked team. If I pick team 1982 by doing `*pick 1982 Cougar Robotics`, then the next player has to pick a team starting with two, like `*pick 2056 OP Robotics`. The bot automatically checks your said team name with the team name registered online on The Blue Alliance and The Orange Alliance, for FRC and FTC teams, respectively. If the bot's wrong, a intuitive reaction based voting system is implemented to override decisions made automatically.
